The project involves 2 parts:

# 1. Clickstream Mining with Decision Trees

It is based on a task posed in KDD Cup 2000, involving mining click-stream data collected from Gazelle.com, which sells legware products. Our task is to determine: Given a set of page views, will the visitor view another page on the site or will he leave?

Implemented the ID3 decision tree learner on Python. The program uses the chi-squared split stopping criterion with the p-value threshold given as a parameter.

# 2. Spam Filter

Implemented Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm to label emails as spam or not spam, using Python. Used Laplacian smoothing to avoid zero probabilities for the data. Achieved an accuracy of 90%.
